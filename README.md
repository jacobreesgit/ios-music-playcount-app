## Technical Details

### Architecture

This project follows a **workspace + SPM package** architecture:

```
MusicCount/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MusicLibraryVerification.xcworkspace/    # Open this in Xcode
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MusicCount.xcodeproj/                    # App shell project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MusicCount/                              # App target (minimal)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Assets.xcassets/                     # App icon and assets
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MusicCountApp.swift                  # App entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MusicCountPackage/                       # üöÄ Primary development area
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Package.swift                        # Package configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sources/MusicCountFeature/           # Feature code
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Tests/MusicCountFeatureTests/        # Unit tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                                    # GitHub Pages website
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html                           # Homepage

### Key Technologies

- **Swift 6.1+** with strict concurrency checking
- **SwiftUI** for all UI components
- **Swift Concurrency** (async/await, actors, @MainActor)
- **Swift Testing** framework for unit tests
- **MediaPlayer Framework** for music library access
- **MusicKit** for Apple Music integration

### Code Style

- **No ViewModels:** Pure SwiftUI state management with @State, @Observable, @Environment
- **Swift Concurrency:** Modern async/await throughout
- **Value Types:** Prefer structs over classes
- **Privacy by Design:** No data collection or external network calls

### Configuration

Build settings managed through XCConfig files in `Config/`:
- `Config/Shared.xcconfig` - Bundle ID, versions, deployment target, team ID
- `Config/Debug.xcconfig` - Debug-specific settings
- `Config/Release.xcconfig` - Release-specific settings
- `Config/MusicCount.entitlements` - App capabilities and entitlements

---

## Development

### Most development happens in the SPM package

Work in `MusicCountPackage/Sources/MusicCountFeature/` for:
- View components
- Business logic
- Data models
- Services

### Public API Requirements

Types exposed to the app target need `public` access:

```swift
public struct NewView: View {
    public init() {}

    public var body: some View {
        // Your view code
    }
}
```

### Testing

- **Unit Tests:** `MusicCountPackage/Tests/MusicCountFeatureTests/` (Swift Testing)
- **UI Tests:** `MusicCountUITests/` (XCUITest)
- Use Swift Testing's `@Test` macro and `#expect` assertions

---

## Privacy & Security

MusicCount is built with privacy as a core principle:

‚úÖ **No Data Collection:** We don't collect, store, or transmit any user data
‚úÖ **Local Processing:** All music library analysis happens on your device
‚úÖ **No Analytics:** No tracking, no telemetry, no user behavior monitoring
‚úÖ **No Third Parties:** No third-party SDKs or services
‚úÖ **Open Source Architecture:** Review the code structure yourself
