## 🚨 CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Submission

### 1. **App Icon Images**
**Status:** Icon infrastructure configured for iOS 26, but NO actual image files
**What's needed:**
- 1024x1024px PNG file (standard icon)
- 1024x1024px PNG file (dark mode variant - optional but recommended)
- 1024x1024px PNG file (tinted variant - optional)

**Action:** Add icon image files to `MusicCount/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`

### 2. **Development Team**
**Status:** `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` is empty in `Config/Shared.xcconfig`
**What's needed:**
- Your Apple Developer Team ID (10-character string)
- Must be set for App Store distribution signing

**Action:** Set `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = YOUR_TEAM_ID` in Shared.xcconfig

### 3. **Privacy Description Text**
**Status:** Too technical - says "Phase 1 technical verification"
**Current:** `This app needs access to your music library to verify what songs and play count data are accessible via MPMediaLibrary for Phase 1 technical verification.`

**Recommended:** `MusicCount needs access to your Apple Music library to track and compare play counts across your songs.`

**Action:** Update line 29 in `Config/Shared.xcconfig`
