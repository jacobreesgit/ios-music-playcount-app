    <h1>Privacy Policy for MusicCount</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 29, 2025</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Privacy Summary:</strong> MusicCount does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data. All music library information stays on your device.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>
    <p>MusicCount accesses your Apple Music library to provide its core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Song titles and metadata (artist, album, genre)</li>
        <li>Play count statistics</li>
        <li>Library organization information</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>This information is only accessed locally on your device and is never transmitted, stored, or shared.</strong></p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The music library data accessed by MusicCount is used exclusively to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display your music library with play count information</li>
        <li>Identify duplicate songs with different play counts</li>
        <li>Compare play counts between songs</li>
        <li>Queue songs to your Apple Music app</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All processing happens locally on your iPhone. No data leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>MusicCount does not store any of your music library data permanently. When you close the app, any cached information is cleared. Your preferences and settings (such as queue behavior and sorting options) are stored locally using iOS standard storage mechanisms and are never transmitted elsewhere.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not share any data with third parties because we don't collect any data.</strong></p>
    <p>MusicCount:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does not connect to any external servers</li>
        <li>Does not use analytics services</li>
        <li>Does not contain advertising</li>
        <li>Does not sell or share user data</li>
        <li>Does not use tracking technologies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>MusicCount does not integrate with any third-party services, SDKs, or analytics platforms. The app interacts only with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apple's MediaPlayer framework (to access your local music library)</li>
        <li>Apple Music app (to queue songs for playback)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>MusicCount does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since we don't collect any data at all, the app is safe for users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>Since no data is transmitted or stored on external servers, your music library information remains protected by your device's built-in iOS security features. We have designed MusicCount to respect your privacy by default.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You can control MusicCount's access to your music library through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>iOS Settings</strong> → <strong>Privacy & Security</strong> → <strong>Media & Apple Music</strong> → <strong>MusicCount</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can revoke access at any time. Deleting the app removes all associated data from your device.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or MusicCount's privacy practices, please contact us:</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>11. Legal Basis</h2>
    <p>MusicCount operates under the principle of data minimization. We only access the information necessary to provide the app's functionality, and we do so with your explicit permission (granted when you authorize music library access).</p>
